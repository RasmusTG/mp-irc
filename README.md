# MP-IRC #

This is both an attempt to build a multi-platform IRC client, as well as an attempt to work with Electron wrapping Angular2.

## Development ##

Use the npm script `start` to run the ng build script and tsc in watch mode and start the electron app.

WIP

## Notes ##

There is an associated set of blog entries at hwillkruse.com describing what I'm doing and a set of tags on the repo that are each associated with one of the entries.

The first entry in that series is at https://hwillkruse.com/electronangular2-getting-started/
